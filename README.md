## Overview

The HBnB Evolution project is designed to help you learn how to build a web application from scratch. You will create a web application with the following components:

1. **Sketching with UML**: Designing the architecture using Unified Modeling Language (UML).
2. **Testing Our Logic**: Creating tests for the API and business logic.
3. **Building the API**: Implementing the API using Flask.
4. **File-Based Data Storage**: Starting with a file-based system for data storage.
5. **Packaging with Docker**: Containerizing the application using Docker.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following layers:

1. **Services Layer**: Handles all the requests and responses.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Processes and makes decisions.
3. **Persistence Layer**: Manages data storage, initially file-based.

Key entities in our data model include Places, Users, Reviews, Amenities, Country, and City.

## UML Diagram

Here is a UML diagram representing the core entities and their relationships:

**Entities**:

- **Place**
  - Attributes: id, name, description, address, city_id, latitude, longitude, host_id, number_of_rooms, number_of_bathrooms, price_per_night, max_guests, amenities, reviews, created_at, updated_at
- **User**
  - Attributes: id, email, password, first_name, last_name, created_at, updated_at
- **Review**
  - Attributes: id, place_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at, updated_at
- **Amenity**
  - Attributes: id, name, created_at, updated_at
- **Country**
  - Attributes: code, name
- **City**
  - Attributes: id, name, country_code, created_at, updated_at

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Erwan2072/holbertonschool-hbnb.git
   cd holbertonschool-hbnb
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

```
3. Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:
```
flask run

```
2. The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
